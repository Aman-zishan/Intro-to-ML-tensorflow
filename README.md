*This Repository contains the notes and code snippets from the "Intro to tensorflow for deep learning" course from Udacity.*

**Artificial Intelligence** : A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning.

- *Machine Learning*: A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them.

- *Neural Network*: A construct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning, and will be covered in this course.

- *Deep Learning*: A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks. Often, “machine learning” and “deep learning” are used interchangeably.

Why **Machine Learning?**

*Traditional Software Development*: The input and the algorithm is known, and you write function to produce an output.

- Input Data
- Apply logic to it
- Get output / result

Whereas in *machine learning* You know the input and output, but you don't know the algorithm  that creates the output given the input.

- Take pair of input and output data
- Figure out the algorithm

Some *machine learning* terminologies:

- **Feature** : The input(s) to our model.

- **Label** : The output our model predicts.

- **Example** : A pair of inputs/outputs used during training.
